GoFootball is a booking system for football playgrounds. It serves players and playground owners by connecting them together. An administrator oversees the overall operations of the system and ensures that no fraud takes place. Anyone can register himself on the system and create a profile. Users can see the playgrounds near to them or in a specific area or all of them using a command line interface.
